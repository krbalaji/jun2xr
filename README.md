Juniper to Cisco XR Migration 
This program helps to migrate the Jun OS based router configurations to Cisco ASR 9000 XR platform. This conversion is based on my last experience working on a migration project with clsoe to 20 plus Juniper nodes migrated to Cisco ASR 9000 XR platform.
Here, I am not concentrating on Infrastructure Setup to build Cisco ASR 9000 node part of Core network. As minimum requirement is to deploy node into the production network with IGP, MPLS and MPBGP etc, that for mandatory for MPLS based services to work.
